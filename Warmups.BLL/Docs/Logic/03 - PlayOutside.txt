The children in Cleveland spend most of the day playing outside. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean isSummer, return true if the children play and false otherwise. 

PlayOutside(70, false) → true
PlayOutside(95, false) → false
PlayOutside(95, true) → true

class PlayOutside
{
//Main() method
    static void Main(string[] args)
{
//function call
    Console.WriteLine("PlayOutside(70, false) : "+ PlayOutside(70, false));
    Console.WriteLine("PlayOutside(95, false) : "+ PlayOutside(95, false));
    Console.WriteLine("PlayOutside(95, true) : "+ PlayOutside(95, true));
}
//This method return true/false based on temeperature and summer
    public static bool PlayOutside(int temp, bool isSummer)
{
//checking temeparture
    if(temp>=60 && temp<=90 && isSummer==false)
{
//when the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive) and its not a summer
    return true;
}
    else if (temp >= 60 && temp <= 100 && isSummer == true)
{
//when the temperature is between 60 and 100 (inclusive) and its a summer
    return true;
}
    else
{
    return false;
}
}
}
