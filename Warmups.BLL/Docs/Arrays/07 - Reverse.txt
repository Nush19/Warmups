Given an array of ints length 3, return a new array with the elements in reverse order, so for example {1, 2, 3} becomes {3, 2, 1}. 

public int[] Reverse(int[] numbers) {
    //defining beginning and end variable
    int beg = 0, end = numbers.Length - 1;
    //loop iterate till beg has lesser value than end
    for(beg < end);{
        int t = numbers[beg]; //t has a element which is reffered by beg
        numbers[beg]=numbers[end]; //storing end index's element at beg index
            numbers[end]=t; //t is stored at end position
            beg++; //incrementing beg index
            end--;//decrementing end index
        }
        return numbers;
    }
 }
